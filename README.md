# Final-Project

## Breast Cancer Classification using SVM's.
By: Aarav Desai, Sanjay Subramanian, Tanmay, Runze Shao, Shahab Khorasanizadeh, and Justin Estes

We got our data from [BCSC](https://www.bcsc-research.org/data/rfdataset/dataset). We used the 2nd risk estimation dataset in our project, which contained over 100,000 rows of data.



## Description

### Motivation

The motivation for this project was to use power of machine learning and its tools to analyze large amounts of data to visualize the various patterns between the patients and quickly identify the patients that are diagnosed with breast cancer which may not be visible to experts.

### Tools Used

- For the exploratory data analysis part we used a combination of Matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots like histograms, heatmap, correlation matrix, violin plots and strip plots. 

- In the machine learning part we used the sklearn library to create a linear regression model to predict the R-squared value amongst the cancer feature in the dataset with the others.

- In the sklearn library we also used the svm function to create a support vector machine that splits our data into testing and training dataset and gives us a confusion matrix with the classified data with 0 representing patients without cancer and 1 representing patients with cancer.
